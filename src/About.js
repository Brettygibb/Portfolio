      <p>
        Iâ€™m Brett Gibbons, a recent graduate of the Programmer Analyst Program
        at NBCC in Fredericton, New Brunswick. From a young age, my passion for
        computers has driven me to explore the world of programming,
        particularly in web and application development. I am a dedicated and
        hardworking individual, always eager to learn new technologies and
        refine my skills. I thrive on challenges and am constantly seeking
        opportunities that allow me to grow as a programmer. Currently, I am
        actively pursuing a career in the programming field and am excited to
        see where my journey will take me.
